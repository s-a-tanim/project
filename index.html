        </figure>
            <h3>Brief Description</h3>
            <p>In response to the growing environmental concerns associated with CO2 emissions from transportation. This project developed <strong>CarbonMLP</strong>, a deep learning model designed to predict vehicle CO2 emissions based on various vehicle attributes such as engine type, fuel efficiency, weight, and other specifications. The model not only provides accurate predictions but also integrates <strong>explainable AI (XAI)</strong> techniques to enhance transparency, interpretability. This approach make it easier to understand the driving factors behind CO2 emissions. This project aims to support environmental sustainability by providing a powerful tool to identify and mitigate high CO2 emissions from vehicles.</p>
            <figure>
            <img src="P1_2.jpg" alt="Project 1 Image" class="project-image2">
            <figcaption><strong>Figure 2: </strong>Percentage of each vehicle category contribu-
                tiong to total CO2 emissions.</figcaption>
        </figure>
            <h3>Relevant Background</h3>
            <p>Transportation is one of the largest contributors to <strong>greenhouse gas emissions</strong>, primarily through the emission of <strong>carbon dioxide (CO2)</strong>. CO2 is a major driver of global warming, resulting in an increase in average global temperatures and contributing to extreme weather events such as floods, heatwaves, rising sea levels, and more. Vehicle emissions play a significant role in this, with high-performance vehicles often producing more CO2 than fuel-efficient ones.</p>
        
            <p>By accurately predicting vehicle CO2 emissions, it becomes possible to:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Track pollution sources</strong>: Understanding which vehicle models contribute the most CO2 allows for more targeted interventions and regulations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Encourage green vehicle adoption</strong>: Governments and consumers can identify fuel-efficient vehicles, thus promoting cleaner alternatives.</li>
                    <li><strong>Optimize vehicle usage</strong>: For businesses managing fleets, accurate CO2 predictions help in planning for more eco-friendly fleet management.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        
            <p>This project utilizes a dataset from the <strong>Canadian government's open data</strong> to analyze the CO2 emissions of different vehicles and use deep learning techniques to predict their emissions. The approach integrates both <strong>machine learning</strong> and <strong>deep learning</strong> models to provide robust predictions that can drive actionable insights for environmental policies, regulations, and consumer decisions.</p>
        
            <h3>Sustainability Impacts and CO2 Emission Analysis</h3>
            <p>In the context of sustainability, this project goes beyond just predicting CO2 emissions. It provides actionable data that can help shape a greener future. Here’s how the project contributes to sustainability:</p>
        
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Promoting Clean Energy Use</strong>: By analyzing the relationship between vehicle attributes (e.g., engine type, fuel consumption, weight) and CO2 emissions. The project provides data to help consumers make eco-friendly decisions when purchasing a vehicle. Fuel-efficient vehicles, or electric vehicles (EVs), emit significantly less CO2, thus helping to reduce the overall carbon footprint.</li>
                <li><strong>Policy Design and Regulation</strong>: Governments can use these predictions to design <strong>carbon taxation policies</strong> or <strong>emission standards</strong> for vehicles. With accurate prediction tools, governments can identify high-emission vehicles and enforce stricter regulations for these vehicles, promoting the transition to more sustainable transportation.</li>
                <li><strong>Carbon Footprint Reduction</strong>: For organizations managing fleets, being able to predict CO2 emissions allows for more strategic planning. Fleet managers can replace old, high-emission vehicles with energy-efficient or electric vehicles, reducing their fleet’s <strong>overall carbon footprint</strong>. This has direct implications for improving a company's sustainability credentials.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Impact Forecasting</strong>: The model enables long-term forecasting by simulating various scenarios where different kinds of vehicles are introduced into the market. The results from these simulations can inform future decisions on how to reduce overall transportation emissions. For example, governments can forecast the impact of transitioning from conventional fuel cars to electric vehicles (EVs) on national CO2 levels.</li>

            <h1>Secure Federated Learning for Parkinson’s Disease: Non-IID Data Partitioning and Homomorphic Encryption Strategies</h1>

            <figcaption><strong>Figure 1: </strong>The architectural diagram of the method is shown by dividing into three steps.</figcaption>
        </figure>
            <p><strong>Brief Description:</strong><br>
                In this project, we explore methods to improve both privacyterms of federated learning (FL) models by implementing two key techniques: homomorphic encryption and attention-based fusion. In FL it involves client-side training of models using multiple users' data which suffers from drawbacks such as privacy issues and the variability of data across different users (data heterogeneity). To address these challenges, we introduced a Secure Federated Learning (SFL) algorithm that avoids problems associated with Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) data by introducing a proposed partitioning method for datasets. Then, we used homomorphic encryption to securely sum encrypted model parameters. Additionally, attention-based fusion techniques were applied to boost model accuracy and robustness.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Relevant Background:</strong><br>
                Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder thats why detecting its progression early can significantly impact treatment for patients. FL offers a privacy-preserving framework for training machine learning models on distributed data, but the challenge arises from the variability in data (heterogeneity) and the need to protect sensitive patient data. In this study, we handle the problem of Non-IID data in federated learning using homomorphic encryption and attention-based fusion techniques by demonstrating the potential for scalable and secure learning in healthcare.</p>
        
            <p><strong>Sustainability Impacts and Data Security:</strong><br>
                This project addresses two major concerns: improving model accuracy while preserving privacy. The use of homomorphic encryption ensures that sensitive health data remains secure, while attention-based fusion improves model robustness, leading to better disease progression predictions. This approach can be scaled to other healthcare applications where data security is a priority, promoting both privacy and sustainability in data usage.
